# GenAI-Usecase-Doc-Based


## Problem Statement
- The complete understanding of our product is crucial for deployment and maintenance engineers responsible for site installations and upgrades. However, engineers' knowledge gaps due to attrition have led to increased reliance on the development team for issue resolution. This dependence persists, whether among new or experienced engineers, as they often neglect reading provided installation manuals (IM) and other documentation.
- The absence of a robust understanding among engineers and the underutilization of provided documentation lead to frequent escalations to the development team, impacting overall productivity and efficiency.
- The goal is to create an environment where engineers feel equipped and confident to resolve issues independently, reducing stress on the development team and enhancing overall operational efficiency.

## General Information
- To solve the above problem we are trying to build a chat system for specifically scoped document using open source models
- Why are we going ahead with open-source models?
* Open source models are available freely for experimentation of these use-cases
* Flexibility on size of model and data being saved locally unlike other OpenAI models
* Hosted and used locally for the safety of data
* Can be shipped within infra of customer
