# GenAI-Usecase-Doc-Based


## Problem Statement
> Deployment and maintenance engineers who take care of site installations of any product, upgrade need to know the product completely
> Due to a lack of knowledge of the engineers due to attrition in the company every installation issue escalates to the Dev team.
> Engineers new or experienced nowadays are negligent in reading the IM and other docs  provided by Dev either due to lack of time or they feel approaching Dev is a faster way to solve than reading the docs provided.
> Hence due to the nature of intermediate engineers developers are stressed
> Also developers don't feel the need to write an appropriate product installation manual and other documents as DevOps engineers will not read them.

## General Information
- To solve the above problem we are trying to build a chat system for specifically scoped document using open source models
- Why are we going ahead with open-source models?
* Open source models are available freely for experimentation of these use-cases
* Flexibility on size of model and data being saved locally unlike other OpenAI models
* Hosted and used locally for the safety of data
* Can be shipped within infra of customer
